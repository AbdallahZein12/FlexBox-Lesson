# FlexBox-Lesson



Another day of learning! Today was focused on understanding flex boxes and how they work in CSS. I learned how to make a photogallery using flex box attributes as well as the usual margins and paddings as well as sharpening images and cutting out edges. overall, a good CSS lesson!!
